            <h3>Ancient Filipino Roots</h3>
            <p>
                Long before the Spanish arrived, indigenous Filipinos were already 
                preserving meat by cooking it in vinegar and salt. This method 
                helped food last longer in the tropical climate and became the 
                foundation of modern adobo.

            <h3>A Spanish Name, But Not a Spanish Dish</h3>
            <p>
                The term “adobo” was given by Spanish colonizers because the dish 
                reminded them of their own marinade. However, the cooking technique 
                existed centuries earlier, making it truly Filipino.

                recognized as the country’s culinary symbol because of its popularity
